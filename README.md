# RPG-Guild-Manager
First assignment of the class IFT1025, at Université de Montréal. It is inspired by the Guild system in an RPG game, where you can manage heroes, buy gear for them, train them and make them stronger based on the inventory and money that the guild possesses.

It is a text-based input, with a specific format.
